Context: Ported Python PR2CR workflow from GitHub gist to Guile 3
Implementation: Used literate programming with org-mode for maintainability
Design choice: Created simple JSON parser using jq since FreeBSD's guile3 package lacks built-in JSON support
Testing: Verified tangling generates correct Guile scripts with proper module structure
