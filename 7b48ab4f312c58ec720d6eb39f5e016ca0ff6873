Review findings:
1. Scripts had 'nil' or 'no' being written as first line due to :shebang parameter
2. json-simple.scm was missing ice-9 popen import
3. JSON parser didn't check jq exit status
4. Vale styles installation referenced non-existent gist directory
5. README lacked authentication configuration details

Fixes applied:
- Used proper org-babel shebang settings (none for libraries, shebang for executables)
- Added comprehensive error handling in JSON parser
- Updated Vale styles check to verify existence only
- Added detailed configuration section with auth setup instructions
